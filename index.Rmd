## Welcome!

Welcome to GEOG 2015: Introduction to GIS and statistics. During this course you will learn the principles and the basics of spatial data analysis. 

During this course we will use **R** as the main software for both GIS and statistical analysis. R is an extremely versatile and widespread software used by some of the biggest companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter, AirBnB and much more. 

## Get started with R - Installation and basic manipulations

Make sure you install on your computer and get comfortable with it. You will find the tutorial below.

- [Get started with R - Introduction to R](IntroR.html)
- [Get started with R - Basic manipulations in R](BasicR.html)
- [Get started with R - Data frame manipulation in R](DFmanip.html)

## Course exercises

Once you have trained in R and done the small exercises from the tutorials you should be ready to do the exercises following the plan of the course. Below you will find a link to the exercises followed by a short description:

- [Lab 1: Introduction to statistics in R and histograms](Lab_1.html). In this exercise we will focus primarily on descriptive statistics.
- [Lab 2: Introduction to Geographical Information System](https://ntnu.blackboard.com/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_70_1). **ArcGIS exercise!** 
- [Lab 3: Univariate analysis](Lab_3.html). In this exercise you will learn to vizualise and compare variables from two different groups.
- [Lab 4: Introduction to Geographical Information System](https://ntnu.blackboard.com/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_70_1). **ArcGIS exercise!** 
- [Lab 5: Multivariate analysis](Lab_5.html). In this exercise you will learn to vizualise and compare variables from two different groups.
